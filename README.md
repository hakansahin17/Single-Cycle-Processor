# Single Cycle Processor

### Comp303 Computer Architecture - Term Project

This is the term project of the course "Comp 303 Computer Architecture" in Fall 2019 semester.

In this project, we were asked to implement Single Cycle Processor using 32-bit MIPS Instructions, create our own instruction and test both our processor and custom instruction.

The project was created with Logism which can be reached [HERE](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/).

More details about the project can be read in Project Description and Project Report.
